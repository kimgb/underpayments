# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

        intro: |
          Hello there. If you've done **work lately on a farm**, I'm here to help you find out if you've been ripped offâ€”and help you get your money, if you want.

          First, the basics: The minimum wage, with certain exceptions, for a casual farm worker is **$21.61 per hour** before tax.

          So, you think you've been underpaid? Let's find out.
      form:
        title: Tell us about your work
        award: "What industry did you work in?"
        weekly_hours: "How many hours per week did you work, on average?"
        hourly_pay: "How much were you paid per hour?"
        payslips_received: "Were you given any payslips?"
        employment_began_on: "When did your employment begin?"
        employment_ended_on: "When did your employment end?"
        employment_type: "Were you casual, or permanent?"
        calculate: Am I underpaid?
